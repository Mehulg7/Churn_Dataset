# Churn_Dataset
Predicting Customer Churn for a Subscription Service 
1. Data Exploration:
   - Summarize the dataset (missing values, outliers, etc.).
   - Analyze patterns or trends in the data. For instance, do customers on lower-tier plans churn more frequently?

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Normalize numerical features (e.g., Monthly Charges, Total Usage Hours).
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Subscription Plan).

3. Model Development:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting).
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Insights & Recommendations:
   - Identify key factors driving churn (e.g., higher churn rates for customers with fewer usage hours).
   - Suggest retention strategies, such as offering discounts to at-risk customers or improving customer support.
